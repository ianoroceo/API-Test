# Airport Gap ‚Äî API Test Automation Exam

This exam will evaluate your ability to **design, implement, and execute automated API tests** using the [Airport Gap API](https://airportgap.com/docs).  
You are free to use **Java, JavaScript, or TypeScript** with your preferred frameworks and libraries.  

---

## üìñ Short Description

The **Airport Gap API** provides public and authenticated endpoints for airports, distances, and favorites.  
Your task is to **build a maintainable test automation suite** that validates these endpoints across happy paths, negative cases, and advanced scenarios.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Assess your **test automation coding skills** for API testing.  
- Validate your ability to:
  - Structure a clean, maintainable test project.  
  - Cover both **functional** and **negative** scenarios.  
  - Handle **authentication**, **rate limits**, and **data cleanup**.  
  - Demonstrate **good coding practices**, reusable patterns, and meaningful assertions.  

---

## üìù Instructions

1. **Create a new branch from this repository.**  
   - Branch naming convention: `lastname_firstname_api-test`  
2. Implement your solution in either **Java, JavaScript, or TypeScript**.  
3. Use any test framework of your choice (JUnit/TestNG, Jest, Mocha, Vitest, etc.).  
4. Store secrets (API token) in a `.env` file or environment variable.  
   - **Do not commit real tokens.**  
5. Include a `README_LOCAL.md` that explains:  
   - How to install dependencies.  
   - How to run the tests.  
   - Any tags, subsets, or reporting commands.  
6. Ensure all created test data is cleaned up after execution.  
7. Submit via a **Pull Request** with:  
   - Your code,  
   - Setup/run instructions,  
   - A short **Design Notes** section (patterns used, trade-offs, retry/backoff handling).

## ‚úÖ Challenges

You must complete **10 challenges** in total:  

### üü¢ Easy (4)

1. **List airports ‚Äî verify page size**  
   - Call `GET /airports`.  
   - Assert response status is `200`.  
   - Verify the response contains **30 airports** by default.  
   - Check for pagination `links` object (first, last, next, self).  

2. **Airport by ID ‚Äî valid IATA**  
   - Call `GET /airports/:id` with a known valid IATA (e.g., `MNL`).  
   - Assert status `200`.  
   - Verify required fields: `name`, `city`, `country`, `iata`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `timezone`.  

3. **Distance calculation basic**  
   - Call `POST /airports/distance` with two valid airports (e.g., `KIX` and `NRT`).  
   - Assert status `200`.  
   - Verify response includes **miles**, **kilometers**, and **nautical_miles** with non-negative values.  

4. **Pagination navigation**  
   - Call `GET /airports` page 1.  
   - Follow `links.next` to page 2.  
   - Assert page 2 has different first airport ID compared to page 1.

### üü° Medium (4)

5. **Retrieve authentication token**  
   - Call `POST /tokens` with valid email & password.  
   - Assert status `200`.  
   - Store the returned token securely.  

6. **Create and read a favorite**  
   - Call `POST /favorites` with `airport_id` (e.g., `JFK`) and a unique `note`.  
   - Assert status `201`.  
   - Call `GET /favorites` and verify the new favorite exists.  

7. **Update a favorite**  
   - Call `PATCH /favorites/:id` to update the note.  
   - Assert status `200`.  
   - Call `GET /favorites/:id` to confirm the note has changed.  

8. **Negative scenarios**  
   - Call `GET /airports/XXX` (invalid IATA): expect **404**.  
   - Call `POST /airports/distance` missing `to`: expect **422**.  
   - Call `GET /favorites` without `Authorization`: expect **401**.  

---

### üî¥ Hard (2)

9. **Distance property checks**  
   - Verify **Symmetry**: distance(A,B) == distance(B,A).  
   - Verify **Identity**: distance(A,A) == 0.  
   - Verify **Unit conversions** between miles, kilometers, and nautical miles.  

10. **Parallel favorites with cleanup**  
   - Create multiple favorites in parallel (unique notes).  
   - Verify all are added successfully.  
   - Cleanup by deleting the favorites at the end of the test.  

---

## üßÆ Assessment Criteria

Your submission will be assessed on the following:  

1. **Coverage & Completeness (30%)**  
   - Did you implement all challenges?  
   - Did you cover both positive and negative flows?  

2. **Code Quality & Maintainability (25%)**  
   - Readability, modular design, reuse of clients/helpers.  
   - Separation of concerns (client vs test vs data).  

3. **Stability & Reliability (20%)**  
   - Deterministic tests (idempotent).  
   - Handling of retries, backoff, and cleanup.  

4. **Best Practices (15%)**  
   - Use of assertions, schema validation, unique test data.  
   - Respect for API rate limits.  

5. **Reporting & Developer Experience (10%)**  
   - Clear instructions (`README_LOCAL.md`).  
   - Easy local run and CI-ready.  
   - Test reports (HTML/Allure/etc.).
